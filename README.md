# Static Analysis Testing for Javascript apps

Static analysis testing for Javascript application from Testing Javascript course.


## Why I did this ??
Main reason is, for referencing the configuration for my convenience only. Because I won't be able to access the course content when I'm on the VPN and always get confused with the course repo navigation.


## Navigation

[Eslint setup](https://github.com/SanthoshRaju91/static-analysis-testing-js/tree/master/eslint-setup)
[Prettier setup](https://github.com/SanthoshRaju91/static-analysis-testing-js/tree/master/prettier-setup) - Read the README.md file for instruction on enabling prettier on VS code editor.

**Note:** This is only for reference purpose only, I don't intend to use the course content provided by the author. Also I'm not explaining stuff like why we should use, if you want to know such details please the course at [Testing Javascript by Kent C Dodds](https://testingjavascript.com/)
